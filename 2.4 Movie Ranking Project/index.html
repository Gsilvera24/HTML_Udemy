<h1>Best Movies of All Time According to David</h1>

<h2>The movies that have impacted me the most</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
One of the most revolutionary movies ever made. The concept is one that has always stuck with
me.
</p>
<h3>A.I. Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>One of the best Steven Spielberg movies. It is about an Android named David who becomes sentient. 
    This paradigm is actually something that is very real today as A.I. has taken huge leaps.
</p>

<h3>The Fifth Element</h3>
<p> Another Scifi movie. Can you start seeing the trend here? lol This oneIn the 23rd century, a 
    New York City cabbie, Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), finds the fate of the world in his hands 
    when Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) falls into his cab. 
    As the embodiment of the fifth element, Leeloo needs to combine with 
    the other four to keep the approaching Great Evil from destroying the world. </p>
